## Project Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of loan repayment data to identify the key drivers of borrower defaults. Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and predictive modeling, the aim is to build tools that support smarter lending decisions and help reduce financial risks in real-time banking operations.

## Problem Statement

The core challenge lies in minimizing financial risk while maintaining a healthy balance between loan approvals and default management. The objective is to better understand the **demographic and financial factors** influencing repayment behavior, enabling more tailored and effective lending strategies.

## Current Focus

* Conducting detailed EDA to uncover and visualize links between customer characteristics and default risk.
* Applying predictive techniques, including regression analysis, to estimate default probability and strengthen risk assessment frameworks.

## Achievements

* Performed extensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, correcting anomalies, and renaming fields for clarity.
* Identified key demographic and financial indicators of default, informing improvements to credit evaluation processes.

## Status

Work is **ongoing**, with continuous refinement of models and enhancement of analytical approaches to achieve more robust results.
